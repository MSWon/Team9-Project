A : the IS-A Test
	Triangle IS-A Shape - O
	Cat IS-A Feline - O
	Surgeon IS-A Doctor - O
	Bathtub IS-A Bathroom - X

Ask yourself : ¡°does it make sense to say Class X IS-A Class Y?¡±

- If it doesn¡¯t make sense, then there is 
 something wrong with the inheritance design.
- If Class B extends Class A , then Class B IS-A Class A. 
 This is true anywhere in the inheritance tree.
