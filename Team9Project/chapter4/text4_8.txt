¤ıDo consider inheritance when you have common behavior(methods) for multiple
    classes of the same general type.

¤ıDON'T use inheritance just so that you can reuse code from another class,
    if the relationship otherwise doesn't make sense.

¤ıDON'T use inheritance if the subclass and the superclass do not pass the IS-A test.
