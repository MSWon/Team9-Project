¤ıBathtub is not Bathroom. But Bathtub and Bathroom are related! 
  How could we express this relation?

¤ıDoes it make sense to say : ¡°Bathroom HAS-A Bathtub?

¤ıIf yes, Bathroom has a Bathtub as instance variable.

¤ıBathroom has a reference to a Bathtub, but Bathroom does NOT 
  extend Bathtub and vice versa.
