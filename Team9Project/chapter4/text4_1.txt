¤ıWe put common code into a superclass.

¤ıThen we create more subclasses that inherit the common code from the superclass.

¤ıFinally, we can override inherited methods in subclasses by rewriting them.

¤ıSubclass extends the superclass.

¤ıSubclass inherits instance variables and methods of the superclass 
    and adds some new stuff.
