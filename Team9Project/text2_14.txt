  (base types or references). 

¤ıArray is an object, so array variable is a reference 
  to the array object! 

¤ıThere are three steps in creating an array: 

  1.Declare an array (reference) variable of some type.
  2.Create a new array object and assign it to the variable.
  3.Initialize contents of the array with variables of 
    the type that matches the array's type.
