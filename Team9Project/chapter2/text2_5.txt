¤ýFour kinds of variables in Java:

[1] Instance variables: inside class but outside methods without the static modifier.
[2] Class variables: inside class but outside methods with the static modifier. 
[3] Local variables: inside methods. These are not visible outside the method
    In which they are declared.
[4] Parameters: method(& constructor) parameters. These are only usable 
   Inside the method/constructor for which they are defined.
