
¤ýWhen you excute a Java program, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks
  for the main() method from the class you give to the JVM.

¤ýEvery Java program has at least one class with a main() method.

¤ýIf a class doesn't have a main method, it can be used by other classes
  but it cannot be executed as a program.

¤ýThe main method takes one parameter:
  an array of command line arguments.

¤ýAnything that you write inside the main method's curly braces {} will
  be executed by the JVM.
  (Always remember to close a brace that you open!)
