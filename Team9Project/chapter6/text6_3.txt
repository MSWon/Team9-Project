¤ıA layout manager controls the size and the location 
  of the components inside the container component.
 
  ¤ıGridLayout : forces every component to the same size
                           arranged in a grid.
  ¤ıFlowLayout : lets each component choose its own size but places 
                            them horizontally with line wrapping.
  ¤ıBoxLayout : stacks components vertically/horizontally,
 	                even if they could fit side-by-side.
  ¤ıLayouts can be nested: container's child can be another container.
