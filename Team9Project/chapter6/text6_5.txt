¤ıGUI widgets can create different kinds of events
  when the user interacts with them.
¤ıIf we want to do something when the JButton is clicked

 1) Create an event handler that is executed when the 
    action event happens.
 2) Register the event handler to JButton's action event.

¤ıEvent registeration (1):Tell the widget that you want
  			  to listen to an event.
¤ıEvent notification (2):When the event happens,the
			 widget will call your code.
